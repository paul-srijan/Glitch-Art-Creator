# 🎨 Glitch Art Creator

A simple yet powerful tool to create glitch art from uploaded images using HTML Canvas! Apply glitch effects like pixel displacement, color channel shifting, and static noise. Customize the intensity of each effect or let the randomizer create unexpected glitchy visuals. Finally, download your creation with a single click!

## 🚀 Demo

Check out the **[Live Demo](#)** (add link if deployed) and start glitching your own images!

## 📷 Features

- **Image Upload**: Choose any image file to transform.
- **Pixel Displacement**: Move pixels around to distort the image.
- **Color Channel Shift**: Separate and shift RGB color channels.
- **Static Noise**: Add random static noise for an authentic glitchy vibe.
- **Customizable Intensity**: Use sliders to control the intensity of each effect.
- **Randomize Effects**: Generate a unique glitch effect combination with one click.
- **Download Option**: Save your glitch art as a `.png` file.

## 🛠️ Built With

- **HTML5** for the structure
- **CSS3** for styling
- **JavaScript** for effect processing
- **HTML Canvas** API for image manipulation

## 📥 Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/glitch-art-creator.git
   cd glitch-art-creator
   ```

2. Open `index.html` in your browser:
   ```bash
   open index.html
   ```

That's it! You're ready to start glitching images.

## 📄 Usage

1. **Upload** an image by selecting a file.
2. Adjust the **sliders** for each effect:
   - **Pixel Displacement**: Controls the amount of pixel scrambling.
   - **Color Channel Shift**: Moves the RGB channels independently for a glitchy effect.
   - **Static Noise**: Adds random noise to create a grainy, static-filled appearance.
3. Click **Randomize Effects** to apply random effect settings.
4. Once satisfied, click **Download Image** to save your artwork as a PNG.



## 💡 How It Works

The **HTML Canvas API** is used to manipulate image data directly on a pixel-by-pixel basis. Each effect (pixel displacement, color shifting, and static noise) is applied to the image data:

- **Pixel Displacement** moves pixels randomly within a set distance.
- **Color Channel Shift** repositions color channels to create a misalignment effect.
- **Static Noise** adds random colors to pixels for a static-filled look.

## 📋 To-Do

Some ideas for future improvements:
- **Customizable Color Filters**: Add color overlays.
- **Undo/Redo Functionality**: Enable undo and redo for each applied effect.
- **More Effects**: Introduce new glitch effects like wave distortion.
